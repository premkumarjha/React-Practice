    When to Use replace()?

===>string.replace(pattern, replacement);
pattern â†’ The substring or regular expression to match.
replacement â†’ The string or function that determines the new value.
In the .replace() method, $1, $2, etc. are backreferences that refer to captured groups from the regular expression.

str.replace(/(\d{4})/g, "$1-");
**************************************************
/(\d{4})/g â†’ Regular expression that captures 4 digits (\d{4}) in a group ()
"$1-" â†’ The replacement pattern where:
$1 â†’ Refers to the first captured group (4-digit match).
- â†’ Adds a hyphen after each 4-digit match.

input.replace(/(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{4})/, "$1/$2/$3");
**************************************************
Let's break it down:

Regex Pattern	  Meaning
(\d{3})	          Captures first 3 digits (Group 1)
(\d{3})	          Captures next 3 digits (Group 2)
(\d{4})	          Captures last 4 digits (Group 3)
This pattern matches a 10-digit number like "1234567890".

ðŸ”¹ What does "$1-$2-$3" do?
$1 â†’ Inserts the first captured group (first 3 digits).
$2 â†’ Inserts the second captured group (next 3 digits).
$3 â†’ Inserts the third captured group (last 4 digits).
The "-" between them adds dashes between the groups.


/apple/gi  ==>g (Global) â†’ Replaces all occurrences of "apple" in the string, instead of stopping at the first match.

/apple/gi  ==>i (Case-Insensitive) â†’ Makes the search case-insensitive, so it matches "Apple", "APPLE", etc.
