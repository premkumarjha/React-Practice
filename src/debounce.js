Technique	      What It Does	                                                                Example Use

Debounce	      Waits until the user stops typing for X ms, then fires.	                       ✅ Ideal for Search inputs, Form validation while typing,Auto-save when user stops editing,etc

Throttle	      Executes the function at most once every X ms, even if user keeps typing.	     ✅ Ideal for scroll (ex: infinite scroll,etc), resize, Mouse Move Events(mouse move actions,...) 


.>"Wait until user stops" → Use Debounce  //Execute the action only after the user stops doing something for a while.

.>"Don't execute too often" → Use Throttle

.>Search/Validation → Debounce

.>Scroll/Resize → Throttle

//=====>which one is better for auto save ===>

Use Case	                                   Best Technique	                    Why
Auto-save after pause	                         Debounce                     ✅	Save final version only
Save periodically (like live sync editor)	     Throttle                    ⚙️	Save continuously every X sec


****************************************************************************************************************
Final Rule of Thumb:

👉 If your action should happen after user stops doing something → use Debounce.
👉 If your action should happen while user is doing something, but at a limited rate → use Throttle.
⏸️ Wait until user stops doing something	Debounce
⏩ Keep updating while user is doing something, but limit rate	Throttle

  /* once we will stop typing after one sec of that fun will be called., also check  ....other scanario.. exapliand below
  
  Scenario 1: User types continuously (e.g., typing "Hello")
text
User types: H -> e -> l -> l -> o (all within 1 second)
┌─ "H" at 0ms   → timer starts (1000ms)
   ├─ "e" at 200ms → cancel previous (800ms left), new timer (1000ms)
   ├─ "l" at 400ms → cancel previous (800ms left), new timer (1000ms)
   ├─ "l" at 600ms → cancel previous (800ms left), new timer (1000ms)
   └─ "o" at 800ms → cancel previous (800ms left), new timer (1000ms)
      ╰─ After 1800ms (1000ms from last keystroke) → function called with "Hello"

Scenario 2: User types one char, waits > 1 sec, types another
text
User types: "H" → waits 1.5 sec → "e"
┌─ "H" at 0ms   → timer starts (1000ms)
   ╰─ At 1000ms → function called with "H" (waited full delay)
┌─ "e" at 1500ms → new timer starts (1000ms)
   ╰─ At 2500ms → function called with "He" (waited full delay)


Scenario 3: User types slowly, but not enough gap (less than delay)
text
User types: "H" → waits 800ms → "e" → waits 700ms → "l"
┌─ "H" at 0ms   → timer starts (1000ms)
   ├─ "e" at 800ms → cancel previous (200ms left), new timer (1000ms)
   ├─ "l" at 1500ms → cancel previous (300ms left), new timer (1000ms)
   ╰─ After 2500ms (1000ms from last keystroke) → function called with "Hel"


Scenario 4: User types, then deletes, then waits
text
User types: "H" → "e" → backspace → "i" → waits
┌─ "H" at 0ms   → timer starts (1000ms)
   ├─ "e" at 200ms → cancel previous, new timer (1000ms) → "He"
   ├─ backspace at 400ms → cancel previous, new timer (1000ms) → "H"
   ├─ "i" at 600ms → cancel previous, new timer (1000ms) → "Hi"
   ╰─ After 1600ms (1000ms from last keystroke) → function called with "Hi"

Scenario 5: User types but navigates away quickly
text
User types: "H" → "e" → navigates away after 500ms
┌─ "H" at 0ms   → timer starts (1000ms)
   ├─ "e" at 200ms → cancel previous, new timer (1000ms) → "He"
   ├─ User navigates away at 500ms (component unmounts)
   ╰─ Timer still running! Will try to execute at 1500ms but may cause errors


Important Fix for Scenario 5 (Navigation Issue):
javascript
// In React component with cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  const debouncedSearch = debounce((input) => {
    fetchUser(input);
  }, 1000);
  
  return () => {
    // Cleanup on unmount - clear any pending timers
    // This prevents "Can't perform state update on unmounted component" errors
  };
}, []);
Key Patterns Summary:
Continuous typing → Single execution with final value

Gaps > delay → Multiple executions (one per "typing session")

Gaps < delay → Single execution with combined value

Deletions → Treated as normal input changes

Navigation away → Potential memory leaks/errors without cleanup

The golden rule remains: Function executes delay ms after the last input change, regardless of what that change is!
